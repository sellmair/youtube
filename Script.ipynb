    "It's quite fascinating that `coroutines`, in the Kotlin ecosystem is almost synonymous with kotlinx.coroutines. However: kotlinx.coroutines is \"just a library\" maintained by the \"Kotlin Libraries\" team. You have all tools necessary for re-implementing kotlinx.coroutines in the standard library and within the Kotlin compiler. Let's try.\n",

    "Here we a very plain and simple Kotlin 'main' function which we can run. There are no surprises, it will greet us with a \"Hello\". \n",
    "However, there is also this 'async' function which could print \"Async\". Now calling this function with kotlinx.coroutines would be as simple as launching a coroutine in some scope and invoking `async`. \n",
    "In this video I'll show how to implement the basics of kotlinx.coroutines such as invoking this `async` method, Dispatchers and switching context by providing our own `withContext` method. \n",

    "# Creating the first coroutine\n",
    "We can create the first coroutine taking any reference to a `suspend` fun and create a coroutine from it using the `createCoroutine` function. \n",
    "Note this `createCoroutine` is coming straight from the Kotlin stdlib. \n",
    "This function requires us to provide a `Continuation`. This object will care about two things: \n",
    "1. It will carry the `coroutine context` of the coroutine: We'll pass an `EmptyCoroutineContext` for now\n",
    "2. It provides the `resumeWith` function which gets invoked once the coroutine finished. In this case we're just getting the value or throw on any error."
