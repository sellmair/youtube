Literally Nothing is really, really good in Kotlin.
Of course I am talking about my favorite feature in 
Kotlins Type-System called 'Nothing'. 

You probably know that every type has to be a subtype
of 'Any' (or Any?) if we include Nullability. 

However, the 'Nothing' type is special! Its called
a 'Bottom' type and beautifully enough its the opposity of 
'Any'. It can never exist, its nothing! 

But what does it mean to be the opposite of 'Any?'
When every type has to implement Any? in Kotlin, then
in order to be the opposite of it, 'Nothing' has to subtype
every other possible type in Kotlin!

And this is exactly what it is!
